Since Yazd, Iran, which was a significant part of the country, was protected from
the deliberate destruction of the Mongols during Muzaffarids era, it can be expected
that there have been continuous construction activities in this area since the Seljuq era.
Especially considering the specific political field, a special local style called
Muzaffarid or according to Donald Wilber "Yazd school" under the influence of
Muzaffarid rulers can be identified and introduced in this field. The purpose of this
article is determining the spatial quality of Sarabostan in the architecture of
Muzaffarid-Timurid houses in Yazd region. In this study, the oldest houses that have
been registered and identified so far have been cited along with historical texts.
Considering the insufficient Ilkhanate houses in other parts of Iran and the number of
historical references to the house in the historical text of Yazd and also lack of enough
research in this field, this article discusses the importance and position of Sarabostan
in the residential architecture of Muzaffarid era. The present study tries to recognize
the residential architecture in the Muzaffarid era by combining interpretive-historical
methods and study of examples and relying on library-documentary studies, as well as
examining and analyzing the house-garden architecture of this period. The results of
library research show that Sarabostan is seen frequently and in different forms in the
historical texts of the Ilkhanate-Timurid era of Yazd. Researches show that in
accordance with the existing house-gardens and historical texts of Yazd, three types
of Sarabostan have been identified. The first category includes houses with a pit-
wooded land garden that is combined with the porch. The second category includes
houses that have a small garden called "Behind the garden" (Khalfe Bagh). This
category has two subspecies, the first one is included four- Iwan (porch chamber)
houses with Khalfe Bagh and the second one includes Ilkhanate houses with a back
garden.
