Yazd, since it has fewer ups and downs and social ups and downs,
architecture in a calm bed has continued in a quiet context. Security concerns
and relative calm during the Middle Ages and the digging of numerous
aqueducts have paved the way for the emergence of gardens in Yazd city.
Therefore, due to the extensive use of gardens in the historical texts of Yazd
and the lack of research on the medieval gardens of Yazd, this article
addresses this issue. This article aims to study the characteristics of the
mentioned gardens in the historical text and the components of these gardens.
The research method of this article is based on historical documents and
library studies. The method of this analytical-historical research and its main
source is historical sources such as the book "Tarikh-e yazd" and " Tarikh-e
Jadid-e Yazd" and "Jame e Mofidi". This article describes historic gardens
from aspects of architecture, decorations, function, developments, creators,
and factors of origin. The historical scope of this research is from the birth of
Yazd to the tenth century AH. It includes the gardens of the first centuries
AH, the period of Al-Kakuieh, Atabakan, Al-Muzaffar, Timurids, and
Safavids. This study shows that Yazd gardens have local and indigenous
characteristics that are common in this area. According to historical sources,
it is undeniable that the architectural methods and local decoration have
entered the garden building. Also, the evolution of gardens throughout history
and various activities in Yazd gardens show that some gardens are multi-
functional. Finally, as the founders of the gardens, local rulers and nobles have
played a major role in digging canals and ultimately forming historic gardens.
